    "An organisation has a visitor car park with 20 car parking spaces numbered 1 to 20. Car park spaces can be booked by visitors up to two week before the date they are needed, as long as a space is available. Visitors request a car parking space by stating the day in the two-week period in which it is required. They give the licence number of the car to be parked and their name. The next available space beginning at space 1, is allocated and the given data and booking are stored. A system is required to record the car park booking. <br> <br>\n",

The data structures should have sufficient capacity to store data for each of the 20 parking spaces for a static period of two weeks. Allow a visitor to request a parking space on any day within the two-week period by entering a number between 1 and 14, inclusive. The system will check that there that there are spaces available on the day requested, and if so, will ask the visitors to enter their name and car licence number. The data will be stored in the data structures representing the first available parking space for the day requested. The visitor will be told the number of their parking space. <br>\n",
